## My life so far

Overall, my life has been pretty good so far.

Currently product designer at [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) — a tool that makes producing for web more approachable. Mostly trying to figure out how to create the right visual tools for designers.

## Webflow

<small>2015–2018</small>

- **Grid**: A flexible layout mechanism with direct manipulation controls, built on top of CSS Grid.
  - [webflow.com/grid](https://webflow.com/grid) (grid playground in Webflow)
  - [youtu.be/Z0TpdiMFVIk](https://youtu.be/Z0TpdiMFVIk) (demo video)
- **Interactions**: A system allowing designers to visually create complex web interactions and animations without any coding skills.
  - [webflow.com/ix2](https://webflow.com/ix2) (launch page, designed by [Ryan Morrison](https://ryry.io))
  - [webflow.com/interactions-animations](https://webflow.com/interactions-animations) (product overview)
  - [youtu.be/RmTIx9I78QI](https://youtu.be/RmTIx9I78QI) (demo video)
- **Flexbox**: Visual interface to CSS Flexbox mechanism allowing designers to create expressive, responsive layouts on the web.

  - [flexboxgame.com](https://www.flexboxgame.com/) (flexbox game built in Webflow)

## Stampsy, 2012–2014

- Worked as a designer (and partly as a front-end engineer) at Stampsy — a web platform for sharing and discovering visual stories. I designed the product and built a modular CSS architecture behind it.

- In 2012, before becoming a web platform, Stampsy was an experimental iPad app for creating stories with a simple design edit
  or. I designed and prototyped a lot of its touch-based interactions with different tools and codez.

## Misc

- At some point I designed a [UI theme](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) for Sublime Text — a popular code editor. It's been installed by [~400k users](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Spacegray) and has ~7k stars on GitHub.
- During 2010–2012 I've freelanced and worked with various international startups, but most of the time I was posting [useless stuff](https://dribbble.com/gadzhi) on Dribbble.
- In my early twenties I've played a lot of World of Warcraft — a multiplayer online game. It's quite intense and requires a lot of concentration. I had a lot of fun designing and building custom interfaces for it, which improved my performance and overall game experience. I think that's what got me into design.
