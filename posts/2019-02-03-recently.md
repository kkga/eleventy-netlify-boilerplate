## Gamedev adventures

I'm still working on the little puzzle game that I've been messing with for a few months already.

It's a game about finding a path to the exit, but the movement can only be done in straight lines until you hit an obstacle on the way. I've coded a bunch of different mechanisms that can interact with the player in different ways and are supposed to make the gameplay a bit more interesting.

All the building pieces seem to work great on their own: moving the player is fun and the various mechanics feel nice to interact with. However, I'm stuck on building the actual levels -- it's easy to design a few introductory levels that teach the basic rules, but future levels get either to dull and simple or too chaotic.
