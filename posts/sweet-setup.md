> Who are you and what do you do?

My name is Gadzhi Kharkharov and I am a product designer at Webflow.

> What is your current setup?

I have a MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Mid 2013). Since I'm working remotely and mostly from coffee shops and coworking places, I don't have any additional gear like an external display. 13" laptop works fine for my needs most of the time.

> Where can we find your OS X wallpaper?

I always have one of the default OS X wallpapers.

> What software do you use and for what do you use it?

- **OmniFocus**: this might be a bit of an overkill for my to-do needs, but I've tried a lot of alternatives and none of them has as many different ways to get stuff into it — I'm especially dependent on the OF's mail drop feature.
- **Nylas N1**: I'm not a hardcore email user, my Inbox is Zero most of the time. Whenever I get an actionable email, I forward it to OmniFocus mail drop and deal with it later. As for N1, I like it's [design][1] and flexibility. The app constantly evolves and has regular updates.
- **Atom**: I've been a Sublime Text user for a long time and even designed [Spacegray][2] — one of the most popular UI themes for it. When the first Atom beta hit public I decided to give it a try and I'm using it as my go-to code editor since then. I like the constant updates and improvements Atom team brings to us and love seeing the evolvement.
- **Cloudup**: there are a lot of screenshot-sharing apps out there, but I like Cloudup because it's free and simple.
- **Copied**: this app syncs my clipboard history across Mac and iPad.
- **Dropbox**: I had a paid plan for as long as I can remember. Dropbox is my personal storage, photo archive, sync service and, probably, something else.
- **Framer Studio**: I've been using Framer.js for UI prototyping since it was an open-source library and the Framer Studio app didn't exist. Most recently I've switched to [Principle][3], because my prototypes are usually quite simple and I like getting quick results without investing a lot of time. But the [latest update][4] to Framer Studio looks intriguing and I've yet to try the more visual approach.
- **IconJar**: Webflow uses around 500+ icons in it's UI and this free app has been a relief for finding, managing and copy-pasting them in Sketch.
- **iTunes**: I'm an Apple Music user, since we don't have any decent alternatives in Russia. Can't say much about it, but I wish iTunes app was a bit less bulky. It's funny that most web apps are now faster than some native OS X apps.
- **Lingo by NounProject**: this visual asset manager is a new addition to my setup and it's been pretty great so far. I grab a lot of UI screenshots as visual notes and inspirations during my workflow and this app suits my needs perfectly. I'm aware of the countless alternatives, but this app is faster and simpler. It's a good example of a well-done web app.
- **Numi**: it's a smart little calculator app that I use during design workflow. It's handy for calculating grids/gutters and other dimensions when laying out a UI.
- **Principle**: my favorite prototyping tool. I'm an avid user since the first release and I love the approach of this app. It's fast, simple and helps getting quick results without investing a lot of time.
- **QuickCast**: this is a screencast app that allows you quickly create a recording of your screen (5 mins max), uploads it to the web and gives you a shareable link. It's super simple and we use it a lot for communicating ideas in Slack channels.
- **Reeder**: I still use RSS for most of my content consumption needs. I love how this technology feels almost analogue nowadays. I have my Feedbin and Instapaper accounts in Reeder and use it both on OS X and iOS.
- **Slack**: you got this.
- **Sketch**: I do most of my design work in Sketch since the first beta release of Sketch 2 in 2012. I like the focus of Bohemian Coding on making it actually more useful every major release and avoiding unnecessary features.
- **Telegram**: I use it for communicating with friends. I'm also subscribed to a few channels but can't say that I check them out very often.
- **Tweetbot**: not a hardcore Twitter user, but I do tweet accidentally and for that I prefer Tweetbot on OS X and iOS.

> How would your ideal setup look and function?

The 13" Retina MacBook Pro desperately needs an update and I'm mostly concerned about the display. I'm using it for almost 3 years and while it was pretty good back in the days, it feels really outdated now. The logical resolution of 13" Retina display is too small and I wish the next generation of MBP to have a display similar to the 12.9" iPad Pro, which is stunning. Hopefully we'll see an update this year.
